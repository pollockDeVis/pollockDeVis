### 👋 Hello, I'm Palok, a PhD candidate at TU Delft's [HIPPO Lab](https://github.com/Hippo-Delft-AI-Lab)!

I'm presently:
- 🌍 Enhancing Integrated Assessment Models to facilitate Normative Uncertainty Analysis for crafting equitable Climate Policies.
- 🤖 Harnessing the power of AI (MOEA and RL) to discover Pareto-optimal policies that enable international cooperation.
- 👨‍💻 Building [JUSTICE](https://github.com/pollockDeVis/JUSTICE), an open-source tool for Integrated Assessment Modeling to explore Normative Uncertainty.
